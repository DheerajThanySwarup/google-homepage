The Odin Project Curriculum: Learn Web Development for Free
This repository houses the curriculum used by The Odin Project. It is available for free to anyone who would like to learn web development in a project-focused and collaborative environment.*

See it live at theodinproject.com/curriculum.

Students, educators, and developers are encouraged to make contributions to the curriculum. It has been greatly simplified so that it should be a rather straightforward process -- just fork this repository, make your changes (e.g. adding the link to your solution for one of the exercises), then submit a pull request. The lessons presented at theodinproject.com/curriculum are all stored in their appropriate course directories here.
